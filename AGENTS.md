# Project AGENTS.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This AGENTS.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project Structure for OpenAI Codex Navigation

- `/EduVS`: Main WPF application project that OpenAI Codex should analyze and update
  - `/ViewModels`: MVVM view models where OpenAI Codex should implement UI behavior and orchestration logic
  - `/Views`: XAML views and code-behind files where OpenAI Codex should keep presentation concerns
  - `/Models`: Data models used across the app that OpenAI Codex should keep simple and serializable
  - `/Helpers`: Utility and integration helpers (CSV, PDF, QR, font/picker helpers) that OpenAI Codex can extend carefully
  - `/ViewHelpers`: UI converters and related helpers used by bindings
  - `/Resources`: Static assets such as embedded fonts (OpenAI Codex should not modify binary assets directly unless requested)
  - `/Properties`: Application settings, launch profiles, and publish profiles
- `/EduVS.sln`: Solution entry point that OpenAI Codex should use for build/test commands

## Coding Conventions for OpenAI Codex

### General Conventions for AGENTS.md Implementation

- Use C# for all new production code generated by OpenAI Codex
- OpenAI Codex should follow the existing MVVM structure and code style in each file
- AGENTS.md requires meaningful class, method, and variable names in OpenAI Codex output
- OpenAI Codex should add concise comments only for non-obvious or complex logic
- Prefer small, focused changes that align with existing architecture

### WPF + MVVM Guidelines for OpenAI Codex

- Keep view logic in `ViewModels` and limit code-behind to UI wiring concerns
- Ensure property updates support data binding (`INotifyPropertyChanged` patterns already used in the project)
- OpenAI Codex should preserve XAML readability and existing naming conventions
- Avoid introducing new frameworks or large architectural shifts unless explicitly requested

### Data and File-Processing Standards for OpenAI Codex

- Preserve existing data formats when touching CSV/PDF/QR workflows
- Validate user-input-derived values before file generation/export operations
- Keep helper methods deterministic and testable where practical

## Testing Requirements for OpenAI Codex

OpenAI Codex should run checks with the following commands:

```bash
# Restore solution dependencies
 dotnet restore EduVS.sln

# Build the solution
 dotnet build EduVS.sln

# Run tests (if test projects are added)
 dotnet test EduVS.sln
```

If no test projects exist, OpenAI Codex should still run restore and build checks successfully.

## Pull Request Guidelines for OpenAI Codex

When OpenAI Codex helps create a PR, ensure it:

1. Includes a clear summary of the changes made
2. Explains why the change was needed
3. Confirms build/test status and any limitations
4. Includes screenshots for UI changes when applicable
5. Keeps the PR focused on a single concern

## Programmatic Checks for OpenAI Codex

Before submitting changes generated by OpenAI Codex, run:

```bash
# Restore dependencies
 dotnet restore EduVS.sln

# Build validation
 dotnet build EduVS.sln -c Debug

# Optional release validation
 dotnet build EduVS.sln -c Release
```

All applicable checks should pass before OpenAI Codex generated code can be merged. AGENTS.md helps ensure OpenAI Codex follows these requirements.
